#### Setup

1. Make a branch for yourself. All your work should go into that branch
2. Make 'data' and 'notebooks' folders. If you plan to make maps, you can also make a `maps` folder
3. `add`, `commit`, `push` to create your branch

### Important notes

- Everyone is highly encouraged to incorporate additional datasets into their analysis. Doing so will greatly enhance your insights. For example, council districts or codes violations datasets available at <https://data.nashville.gov/>
- The group assignments are not meant to be rigid. Please feel free to nudge your analysis where your investigation leads
- Communication is paramount. Please communicate with your teammates, other groups working on the same assignment and the whole class
